                <h3>Masters and Doctorates Degree</h3>
                <p> In 2010-2014 first generation students that decided to achieve a masters degree took longer than other students achieving their doctorate, however in 2014 a person with a doctorates average salary was the same as a first generation student with a doctorate. From 1994 to 2014, roughly one-half of all doctorate recipients graduated with outstanding debt incurred during their undergraduate and graduate education. In 2014 first-generation college students who went on to earn a doctorate were more likely than other doctorate holders to have outstanding debt at the time of graduation (53% versus 46%). Overall, 24% of doctorate holders who were first-generation college students but only 17% of other doctorate holders reported graduate education-related debt in excess of $30,000 at the time of doctorate award.</p>
